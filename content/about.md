Hey there! This is me and my fam. On a holiday. Shot on a film. With Canon AE-1 Program. Nothing to see there ðŸ˜œ

Tired of scrolling through endless ads on Instagram? Want to see only what you really subscribed to? Looking for high quality photos rather than phone-screen-sized compressed pictures? And so am I.

I made this blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.com), [Photopasta](https://github.com/trustmaster/photopasta), and [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com).

You can subscribe to updates via [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) with your favorite RSS reader app using a link in the footer. You can also follow the updates in Telegram via [Octomat.io Bot](https://octomat.io) using this [Follow in Telegram](https://t.me/OctomatioBot?start=cGhvdG9zLmtvZGlneS5jb20vaW5kZXgueG1s) link.
